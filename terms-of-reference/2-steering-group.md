# Steering Group - Terms of Reference

## Introduction

The Apollo Protocol is a collaborative mechanism to unlock the benefits of digital twins across sectors. 
What started as a discussion between individuals from the manufacturing and built-environment sectors at a technology conference, grew to produce the original position piece and then an initial series of events proving the value in approach by its founding members.
To ensure the continued success, this structure establishes clear roles and responsibilities to guide the future direction to enable the convening development of an industrial common language.
The purpose of this document is to describe the roles of the Executive Board in relation to the overall Apollo Protocol structure as fully itemised in Schedule 1.

## Structure

The boards and working groups involved in the Apollo Protocol are:

* Executive Board - This executive body provides a long term strategic direction for the Apollo Protocol and its enabling mechanisms by individual representation. This broadly covers licensing, procurement, stakeholder management, associations and relationships with the Apollo Protocol branding, and assets that are associated with the Apollo Protocol.

* Steering Group - This non-executive body advises the executive board around the current on-going activities. It is composed of a mix of individuals and organisations covering a broad representation of subject matter experts and other interested parties across data management and digital twin landscape.

* Protocol Working Group - This group is composed of subject matter experts and technical individuals from Forum Working Group Members to translate the evidence outputs of the Forum Working Groups into the Apollo Protocol.

* Forum Working Groups - A group formed to manage the capturing of evidence from a cross-sector Apollo Forum to support the development of the Apollo Protocol with representation from interested organisations across the particular cross-sector boundary in consideration.

## Vision

A world where all sectors and industries share a unified common language for data, enabling a sustainable, innovative and thriving society.

## Mission

Develop The Apollo Protocol, a curated open best-practice common language framework supported by Apollo Forums that facilitate collaboration to tackle cross sector challenges to deliver high quality, evidence driven, interoperable outcomes.

## Principles

Our principles encourage open collaborative cross-sector activities, bringing together thought leaders, policy makers, industry, technology providers, academia and translational researchers under one roof to better society.

#### 1. Neutral governance
#### 2. Connected engagement
#### 3. Aligned research direction
#### 4. Collaborative management
#### 5. Policy partnership
#### 6. Openness

## Review

These terms of reference will be reviewed periodically to align with evolving conversations and the on-going direction of travel suggested by stakeholders within the Apollo Protocol. The Executive Board will be responsible for collating all feedback to review proposed changes at a defined review meeting where any changes to the terms of reference will be proposed. All changes will be agreed upon by the Executive Board and ratified by the Chair and Vice Chair at the time of modification.
