# Apollo Protocol: Terms of Reference

The Apollo Protocol is a collaborative mechanism to unlock the benefits of digital twins across sectors. 
What started as a discussion between individuals from the manufacturing and built-environment sectors at a technology conference, grew to produce the original [position piece](https://theiet.org/apollo-protocol) and then an initial series of events proving the value in approach by its founding members.
To ensure the continued success, this structure establishes clear roles and responsibilities to guide the future direction to enable the convening development of an industrial common language.
The purpose of this repositary is to host the roles of the goverance structure in relation to the overall Apollo Protocol structure as fully itemised in each of the _terms of reference_ to achieve our Vision and Mission stated below.

# Vision

_A world where all sectors and industries share a unified common language for data, enabling a sustainable, innovative and thriving society._

# Mission

_Develop The Apollo Protocol, a curated open best-practice common language framework supported by Apollo Forums that facilitate collaboration to tackle cross sector challenges to deliver high quality, evidence driven, interoperable outcomes._
